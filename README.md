# Rails Gift Organizer

The Gift Organizer app gives the user the opportunity to create an event, populate that event with gifts, and assign givers to each of those gifts. The event will become a checklist of gifts in which the user can check off each gift after a thank you note has been sent out to the gift's respective givers.
